But that's I mean, overall, for marketing wise, that's kind of it. Well, I've I myself have reached out to a few sponsorship op opportunities. Haven't really heard back yet, so I need to follow-up with those. Miles, have you had a chance to check-in with, I think you said you were able to check-in with the gyms.

**Greg Kowalczyk:** Was that  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Was that  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** correct?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Typically, I had gotten three contacts and then I started backing off people because everybody kinda said wait till January.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Typically, I had gotten three contacts and then I started backing off people because everybody kinda said wait till January.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** So  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** So  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** we'll we'll probably, would do something, but in again, we're not stepping on your toes. He mentions you and they said, yeah. That's fine. He says, even if you come up with a cheer group or whatever. Right? So they're willing to do something. So I sent them the packet, and so he said he would contact the head office and see what they would be interested in in being able to set up and help us without hurting the the, obviously, the relationship that they have with you guys because he said, you know, he and and he, you know, I said to him, you're helping us even. I says, we're not we're not trying to compete with you. Right. We're looking just, you know, you know, we're looking for whatever. And then for Tino's, same story, because when I approached them just before Christmas, the storm was crazy. Mhmm. And the owners come back January once he has, comes back, and they'll talk about, approaching some vendors in terms of the data company, whatever else, Gatorade, whatever in terms of, you know, he said approach him in the new year. And the third one that I, I've gone and, touched base with, which I haven't heard back yet, I'm I'm waiting probably for next week again to be able to start bugging these people, is the fire hall has a big corporation that has four or five restaurants. Then Fire Hall, Gucci. Yeah. And so I'm trying to get them to think about in terms of involvement with with us as well. So those are the three main ones that I've gotten. And so so once I started getting pushed back from all three of them because of Christmas and New Year's, they're all so busy because of the time of year. I thought I would, wait till now and start hitting some other people because I was just gonna get ready saying it's Christmas time, why are you calling me? It's the worst time of year knocking us off. So, so I think we'll we'll definitely have at least those three, and then I'll start working on some smaller ones and and work around the area. And then, I know I'll let I'll, I'll find some way of posting it on there so that we don't have overlap of people hitting the same people. Right? I have to figure out a way to put up which ones I'm going after, and then if people go after certain ones, we don't wanna have, let's say, Charles going in one place, and then I go after the same guy. Right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** we'll we'll probably, would do something, but in again, we're not stepping on your toes. He mentions you and they said, yeah. That's fine.

Right?  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Did  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Did  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you guys  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** did you guys see? Because I've already created at the beginning of our group chat here on our WhatsApp, there's a file, which I don't think anybody filled out, but I also haven't looked yeah. I think Jahelmi put something in there. But yeah. No. Nobody's filled it out, so I think maybe everyone just kinda missed it. It there is a file in WhatsApp.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** did you guys see?

**Greg Kowalczyk:** Oh, WhatsApp? Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Oh, WhatsApp? Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah. And I created a spreadsheet, and then you can just add, like, other ones that maybe I didn't put in there because I wouldn't have put, like, Firehall or Fortinos or anything like that. You could just add that in so that everybody knows who's oh, fourteen o's is in there too. So you could already put Miles, and so on. So and then also, Miles, I tried calling you and then I kinda got sidetracked with EverTravel and whatever, But I'd love to pick your brain about how you're approaching everybody. So I will call you about that too

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I'd love to pick your brain about that.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I'd love to pick your brain about that.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yep.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yep.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** So awesome. Quick  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** So awesome. Quick  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** question. So  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** question. So  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yep. So  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yep. So  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I understand from the discussion now that if someone knows the contact, then we can go ahead. As long as Myles didn't approach them, we can go ahead and approach them,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I understand from the discussion now that if someone knows the contact, then we can go ahead. As long as Myles didn't approach them, we can go ahead and approach them,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** or  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** show you everything to you. No. No. No. No. Because because people have other ones they're doing, that's no problem. We have answers on the package as to what are the overlap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have no But I don't know No. You can I don't know? If you if you go to Where is the packages that we're offering? Where is that? So So what I've done basically is is I'm I I generally make contact with somebody and then I find a general manager. I have a brief discussion. I tell them who we are, and then  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I find  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I find  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** out who is going to make that type of decision, whether it's the owner of Fortino's Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** And  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** And  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** then you find out which avenue you go. And then I usually ask them, I say, what would be the best way to approach them? I leave it in their hands to tell me how to do it. What's the ask that you're asking? Like, what do you I just go in there and say we're doing this wonderful event in the area. Okay. And you are part of the community, and, it would be really nice if you could, you know, it's a Father's Day thing. It's we're we're, you know, we're we're basically essentially a nonprofit for lack of a better term or not, in terms of what's there. And I said Community. Community. Community. And so, you know, it'd be lovely if if you guys could join us in some form or fashion. And they go, what are you looking for? And I says, well, I says, number of different buckets that we can go into. Mhmm. Whoever is in charge, I'd love to send them a packet, but we are flexible in terms of what you think you could bring the table. It's a partnership. Yeah. So I know Fortunos, for example, was resistant to money. Soon as I said the word money, I backed off. I said, it doesn't have to go, buddy. Yeah. I said, you can give us product. Mhmm. You can give us bottles of water. You can give us teeterator. You can give us bananas. You can give us different things. Okay. Right? And then, so I I try and follow which direction they wanna go in in terms of where they think, they can help. And what do you do if they ask for, like, I need my name to be here and there? Like, Not I don't get into so the details is just to nail down who you need to talk to is the first approach, then send them the packet. Right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** then you find out which avenue you go. And then I usually ask them, I say, what would be the best way to approach them? I leave it in their hands to tell me how to do it. What's the ask that you're asking? Like, what do you I just go in there and say we're doing this wonderful event in the area. Okay. And you are part of the community, and, it would be really nice if you could, you know, it's a Father's Day thing.

Like, Not I don't get into so the details is just to nail down who you need to talk to is the first approach, then send them the packet. Right?  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Once  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Once  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you send them the packet, they can look through it, and then you follow-up with them Oh, yeah. And what they have. As negotiate. Then then we find out what it is that they are they're interested in. Right? So those are kind of the approaches. Now I have all I got was the initial contact, sending them the packet. That's as far as I've gotten. I haven't gone to stage three yet. Okay. Okay? Because of Christmas. Yeah. Christmas and New Year's, I I didn't do that. But the main thing is is I think just sending stuff off blindly will get you  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you send them the packet, they can look through it, and then you follow-up with them Oh, yeah. And what they have. As negotiate. Then then we find out what it is that they are they're interested in. Right? So those are kind of the approaches. Now I have all I got was the initial contact, sending them the packet. That's as far as I've gotten. I haven't gone to stage three yet. Okay. Okay? Because of Christmas. Yeah. Christmas and New Year's, I I didn't do that. But the main thing is is I think just sending stuff off blindly will get you  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** a  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** lot of lot of standard answers. You have to talk to someone and you have to find out who that person is. Yeah. And, for example, I'm gonna go meet the owner at Fortunos. I'm not gonna just send them an email. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I wanna I I in my email, I'm always gonna say, hey. Do you have a time for ten minutes of my time? I give them a small window. Just a small give me five or ten minutes of your time. Let's meet in person because it's a lot harder for people to say no to you in person, okay, than it is  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** on  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** an email. You'll get you'll get email responses that are always negative. Right? Try and get that face to face. Yep. Don't don't Objection. That's that's that's my approach. Do we have a coffee place? We have, like, a coffee place with us. Okay. No. I mean, I I would I'm thinking Peach, but, I mean, he has the relationship with Peach in terms of no. You don't have why you did buy coffee. Yeah. No. There is no I don't think I don't think we have, any The reason I'm asking is because I know the order for wet quite well. But, however, if we want Peach, we wanna approach Peach first. Because my understanding is something that's coffee place, they won't go in if there's someone else. It's being one. Yeah. So Yeah. The only the only thing is just I think, we talked about this last week, not last week, last month Yeah. That, you know, with Tim Hortons that, they might bring their Yes. Coffee chat. They will definitely bring. Right. Yeah. Oh, then that's it. So I think that's I think we will only use the places at Bronte for advertising additional sponsorship or something like this. Right. And  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** so  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** so  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** we need a letter for the shoe. For the shoe? The door. Oh. I'll go check. I'll send you this in orange contact. And you really would have to send a letter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Drive sending No. That's correct. So that would not that I like the, Tim Hortons coffee, but, it's free.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay. We  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay. We  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** need to be using Yeah. I want break anyway. We use specific letters for the shoe manufacturers. Yeah. I can having three s in the letter besides I need a package. Yeah. But we need to have a a standardized letter written up, which I cannot I can I can give you one? Basically, asking for each of the product, product and money, or another area of sponsorship. Mhmm. So that's what I've gained from talking to some of the reps already. So they need that in the letter and then send them whatever package you can make to make a decision. Okay. Okay. Right now, computers for us, sorry, shoe manufacturers are on and yes. Right here in the in the main main screen? Yeah. If you go to sponsorship. Yeah. So in the sponsorship, there is a package. So you can open here. Okay. Later. And, you can visit the play mode. Okay. This sort of, involves you. I I had a really nice long meeting with Kelly. Good for you. Good for you. It was a long meeting. I got the whole, like, sorry. I had some information. No. No. You're saying you know everything about her. That's right. So No. I'm sorry. I was pretty close. Anyway, we finally got brought down to business and, what she is proposing and I I thought I said to Greg, maybe this is something we should talk to you about as well and see if you're feeling she wants to do a special deal, with the Canada Day her Canada Day race and her Father's Day race with if you if you sign up for you just get to sign up for both, then it'll be a, a She has a Father's Day race as well. No. No. No. No. Our Father's Day. I was like, wow. I said to Greg, well, they're all seem to be two weeks apart. We're gonna get a special way for the newly June, the Father's Day's race, and her Canada Day where it's because she is gonna give us access to her database to send all this information to them And part of her, you know, Kelly likes promotions. So if you get a picture of the four of us, I'll confirm a running room or something like that. But, anyway, I don't know your thoughts on that if you wanted to mold the money gene like that or, Greg, we have to, come on a percentage that we're gonna come down on each of the race. And then,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** need to be using Yeah. I want break anyway. We use specific letters for the shoe manufacturers. Yeah. I can having three s in the letter besides I need a package. Yeah. But we need to have a a standardized letter written up, which I cannot I can I can give you one? Basically, asking for each of the product, product and money, or another area of sponsorship. Mhmm.

But, anyway, I don't know your thoughts on that if you wanted to mold the money gene like that or, Greg, we have to, come on a percentage that we're gonna come down on each of the race. And then,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** apparently,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** apparently,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** she knows how to make this all work on race roster. So Yeah. So we, we typically, offer 20% discount to groups of five or more. Right? So we would offer that as possible. Maybe we Yeah. That's what I said the grade is 20%. She does 20% across the board, and you you get, you get that one price, but you get the three races. You're actually gonna have the three races. And the other way to entice Kelly in is that Just get this. Give her a boot in here. Just give me the number. Oh, yeah. Voice over. So she's giving us a booth at all her races, so we can do a set up of a booth at all her races. She's gonna come to ours, obviously. She's already, comes to yours. Mhmm. What else did she talk about? And the good part about doing that is if you don't do that, she'll pressure you to put your her flyers out everywhere. Yes. And then wanna do that right. You just put her in your booth. Put her in your booth. Yeah. Good to go. Yeah. So, and she's arranging for a good a little gamble run. Yeah. She wants to arrange a special restaurant just for bunny runners so we all have our children at one restaurant. Even even when we are we were at the, Toronto Marathon Expo. So she came over, and she left her stuff at our desk.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** she knows how to make this all work on race roster. So Yeah. So we, we typically, offer 20% discount to groups of five or more. Right? So we would offer that as possible. Maybe we Yeah. That's what I said the grade is 20%. She does 20% across the board, and you you get, you get that one price, but you get the three races. You're actually gonna have the three races. And the other way to entice Kelly in is that Just get this. Give her a boot in here. Just give me the number. Oh, yeah. Voice over.

Put her in your booth. Yeah. Good to go. Yeah. So, and she's arranging for a good a little gamble run. Yeah. She wants to arrange a special restaurant just for bunny runners so we all have our children at one restaurant. Even even when we are we were at the, Toronto Marathon Expo. So she came over, and she left her stuff at our desk.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Oh, wow.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Oh, wow.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** The table. What else did you talk about? Just my mind. Yeah. The Yes. We talked about, so I wanted to hear it from her because I've heard it, but I wanted to hear it again. So I said, what did making cash prices do for your rates? And she said, she is amazed that the word-of-mouth when it got around to runners and the upper running groups that they were at offering cash prices. So she said as soon as that came out, she said she started seeing all the numbers go up very quickly, because people wanted to be a part of a race that had cash price even though the cash price is really You first said right. Yeah. It's all So that's one thing I might suggest. What we're trying a little bit with with probably runs and we're really slow off the market a bit is that we're inviting a bunch of, elite runners, charging them, like, half price to enter the race. And then we promote that all their entry fees go into a pool, and that's the prize money. Mhmm. So they are actually self funded with that. Right? And if you get another sponsor that wants to throw a couple more $100 at it, then that's that's terrific. But that that way, they kind of they talk it up with their buddies. It almost turns like a poker game. Yeah. I'm gonna race against you and whoever wins is gonna I haven't figured out it. I did there's one really fast woman and fast guy say racing. Everybody else gonna say, I'm not gonna win anybody's. Right. But they might they might wanna do that just because for $50, they can race that person. And, you know, you only get better ones. There are people that are quicker. Right? Yeah. I'm sorry.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** The table. What else did you talk about? Just my mind. Yeah. The Yes. We talked about, so I wanted to hear it from her because I've heard it, but I wanted to hear it again. So I said, what did making cash prices do for your rates? And she said, she is amazed that the word-of-mouth when it got around to runners and the upper running groups that they were at offering cash prices. So she said as soon as that came out, she said she started seeing all the numbers go up very quickly, because people wanted to be a part of a race that had cash price even though the cash price is really You first said right. Yeah. It's all So that's one thing I might suggest. What we're trying a little bit with with probably runs and we're really slow off the market a bit is that we're inviting a bunch of, elite runners, charging them, like, half price to enter the race. And then we promote that all their entry fees go into a pool, and that's the prize money. Mhmm. So they are actually self funded with that. Right? And if you get another sponsor that wants to throw a couple more $100 at it, then that's that's terrific. But that that way, they kind of they talk it up with their buddies. It almost turns like a poker game. Yeah. I'm gonna race against you and whoever wins is gonna I haven't figured out it. I did there's one really fast woman and fast guy say racing. Everybody else gonna say, I'm not gonna win anybody's. Right. But they might they might wanna do that just because for $50, they can race that person. And, you know, you only get better ones. There are people that are quicker. Right? Yeah. I'm sorry.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Just to ask, how are you guys finding the elite runners? Like, obviously, Charles and you guys all know know some, but then is there, like, a way or a method that you guys have to, like, really pick through to browse? Or  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Just to ask, how are you guys finding the elite runners? Like, obviously, Charles and you guys all know know some, but then is there, like, a way or a method that you guys have to, like, really pick through to browse? Or  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I think my my approach would be go to that like, it's on set up and and just say, you know, this is what we wanna do. Can you help us promote it? And when they know that there's prize money potentially for the target athletes Yeah. Then they'll get on board. Yeah. And there's good boy, Lucas, who talks to other elite athletes all the time and and, like he said, he's in. So he'll be in. He's gonna run that. So that's one we have right there if we can He's will be in. He's gonna be racing it. But I agree Athletics Canada, especially Athletics Ontario, because it wants you to go and say it's Ontario first, would be a way of of getting the detracting the those runners. Absolutely.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Makes Ontario.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I think we're good to do that. Most of those elite runners, when they come in, they ask how many pro spots are available because they don't wanna pay. No. Mhmm.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Mhmm.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Mhmm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** They don't like to pay. I didn't like to pay, and I never put it. So my suggestion is, like, nail that down now. And so you could just say, you know what? We know that there's eight men and eight eight women's post spots available. Mhmm. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** They don't like to pay. I didn't like to pay, and I never put it. So my suggestion is, like, nail that down now. And so you could just say, you know what? We know that there's eight men and eight eight women's post spots available. Mhmm. Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay. That's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** a good idea. And then the rest of it will give them a special fee, and that will be the plot Mhmm. But the you will have to, kind of come up with those names. I I have no idea. Well, I can do that for you.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** a good idea. And then the rest of it will give them a special fee, and that will be the plot Mhmm. But the you will have to, kind of come up with those names. I I have no idea. Well, I can do that for you.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Charles,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** you're in charge of the eight men and eight women pro spot.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** you're in charge of the eight men and eight women pro spot.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Eight men and women. Okay. Eight men and Eight is the magic number. I'll, I'll talk to Kelly again and say you pay 20%. Let's do it. And, yeah, because that gives us, access to a very large data. I was thinking 15% that, you mentioned last time, but if it's 20, yeah, we'll increase it to 20. Yeah. 20 is better. We're no different. Always done that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. And and and Yep. It would be a good idea if we  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Eight men and women. Okay. Eight men and Eight is the magic number. I'll, I'll talk to Kelly again and say you pay 20%. Let's do it. And, yeah, because that gives us, access to a very large data. I was thinking 15% that, you mentioned last time, but if it's 20, yeah, we'll increase it to 20. Yeah. 20 is better. We're no different. Always done that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. And and and Yep. It would be a good idea if we  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** as  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** as  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** much as I want to, if we organize that photo shoot with her and you and Oh, I'll I'll arrange I'll arrange it with yeah. Absolutely. And then, as soon as I talk to, I guess, in from the running room, I'm gonna ask you to join in that meeting with. Okay. Yep. Is that Mark? Yes, Mark. Thank you. Charles Anne's husband. I would've got it No worries. Today except Lucas was sick. Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. There is there is one one thing that, brand from, Global Citizen. So give me a contacts from, or brand another brand from Sound of Music since they  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** are  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** are  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** not doing the, event any longer. Oh, really? Yeah. Just yeah. They they've been kicked up from that event.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** But the event's still going on?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Ah, okay. It's still I thought, yes, the event is not going on, so it doesn't match.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I was gonna say that'd  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** be  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** be  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** better.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** better.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Well, not to this extent. So I basically message, both of them, Brent and the other guy, who is on the board of the Sound of Music. So they kind of, leaning to, towards, you know, helping us out, you know, maybe with the music. I said some you know, we are not in a and, you know, the area is not also, with such provisions like Burlington with a Right. Arena and all that stuff. We have only a small amphitheater, I think. So perhaps, you know, some ideas for the music if they if they have musicians, bands, or anything like that. And do you have a sound guy? You said last time that you you might have a a good one. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Well, not to this extent. So I basically message, both of them, Brent and the other guy, who is on the board of the Sound of Music.

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We don't have that. Yeah. If if that one works. I've done the sound before, and it's just a nightmare. Yeah. Because if it doesn't work If we can use it for both so for both. Right? 100%. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We don't have that. Yeah. If if that one works. I've done the sound before, and it's just a nightmare. Yeah. Because if it doesn't work If we can use it for both so for both. Right? 100%. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** And what time do we want the music at again?  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** And what time do we want the music at again?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Music? No. We will start at the same time. I don't know.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Sorry.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** At what?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** At what?  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** 8AM? No.

**Greg Kowalczyk:** After  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** After  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** they're running.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You know, we'll we'll need that area for, you know, the awards and, you know, the presentations. Yeah. Just before it goes out of my head, we should really start, sending things out or invitations or asking people if they wanna participate as far as vendors for the day, like, getting Yeah. We'll be starting now. Yeah. It's important now, not later. Yeah. And same thing event. Like, was it Zara's house? They're portable thing they may wanna bring down because they're late to do their Mediterranean food. Okay. No. That's that's the idea that, right now we'll be sending out, invitations for for the vendor, Boots. Yeah. But it's gotta be sooner than later. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You know, we'll we'll need that area for, you know, the awards and, you know, the presentations. Yeah.

**Greg Kowalczyk:** No. I mean, you're gonna have to. I am just swamped right now.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay. But you're gonna gonna tell him what to do. Right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I will. Do you have a contact for her? I'll get you the contact. Yeah. We'll get the contact and, yeah, if they are easy to, you know, to say yes. Say the rubber stamp. Yeah. Yeah. Rubber stamp. So I know I know I own vendor piece, so I'm gonna take a look. Yeah. At what are the, like, the must have vendors, like, we we should secure now as in  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I will. Do you have a contact for her? I'll get you the contact. Yeah. We'll get the contact and, yeah, if they are easy to, you know, to say yes. Say the rubber stamp. Yeah.

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** level  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** of 30 and the others we can figure out. I think we can probably space that out over the next couple of weeks. I know. And then, again, we were taught the three of us were talking about going out to the community Yeah. To fill out whatever whatever gaps are left. Mhmm. I think we also need to decide, like, you know, is it I would imagine we can have all only, like, only food vendors. Right? We we need to figure out what that mix is also gonna look like as well. Now the food Yeah. We we said before that we're gonna have only two food trucks. Right. Yeah. And then every everything else, preferably, you know, sports running related. Okay. But not only. Well, you need you need something for the kitties because it is Yeah. For for kids. But, you know or something like that. Keep in mind that, you know, the park is pretty big, and yeah, we can have initially, when I was talking with the town, I said about 30 vendors, but we can have up to 7,500 if we can,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** of 30 and the others we can figure out. I think we can probably space that out over the next couple of weeks. I know.

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** But we need the people to come too.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We need  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We need  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** to  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** be  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** walk  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** around. Yeah. The more  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** around. Yeah. The more  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** right,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** the more More of it. Yeah. So since you know m and m's, they will come and do stuff. There's fucking do, like, a barbecue. Yeah. There is a few Facebook groups specifically for the vendor events. As soon as as soon as you post this there and, you know, there is a application process, they just roll it in. Know. Okay. Yeah. It's not rolling in. I wish I could rolling in. Rolling in. I wish I could rolling in. Really stressful. Like, how are you doing? No. Well, I'm I'm so pays to fill. All the vendors have to be okayed by the, Halton board of HealthSuite. Correct. So Is there Even even even though even though without, if they are not food related? No. Yeah. When we eat the food Food related. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** the more More of it. Yeah. So since you know m and m's, they will come and do stuff. There's fucking do, like, a barbecue. Yeah.

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** That's fair enough. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** That's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** why we only have two. Yeah. I think we is there a reason why two only? You also have  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** why we only have two. Yeah. I think we is there a reason why two only? You also have  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** You have  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** You have  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** more too because the adults are gonna want something and they don't want something to be need to be diversified. Like, you're not getting free coffee vendors, like, coffee, beer, sandwiches, I don't know, bakery. Like Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** more too because the adults are gonna want something and they don't want something to be need to be diversified. Like, you're not getting free coffee vendors, like, coffee, beer, sandwiches, I don't know, bakery. Like Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** could have more than two,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Greg,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Greg,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I think.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I think.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. You have the restroom for the kids. Yeah. But at the same time, you know, if the vendor shows up, they have to make some money as well. Right? So that's  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Like,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** two to  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** two to  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** five. Like,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** two  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** two  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** to five,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** to five,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I think,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I think,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** is  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** is  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** five. Still think, like, people are gonna like, if we only have, like, two vendors, and let's just say, like, 300 people living in London. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is like a pain. No one even want to. Right? We have to create that balance between You remember it's a one way park, and there's gonna be public access and people are walking their dogs and everything. They're gonna be there regardless. Yeah. So they may see it and go up and want something. And that'll happen with the Tim Hortons thing. But Yeah. One of the things, like, are you doing a comp, like, part of their entry fee food? You know, we we repeat the pizza because it's super easy. Mhmm. I don't know if you're if you're not doing that, then it's almost like you need to give a little gift certificate to the food vendors. Okay. Okay. And they do that. And and that has a lot of value for the food vendor. Right? Okay. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. It depends.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** five. Still think, like, people are gonna like, if we only have, like, two vendors, and let's just say, like, 300 people living in London. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is like a pain.

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** But  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** But  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** know what we can also do is I'm gonna just research because I'm just looking, but there's, like, fairs or some kind of shows that what we if it's, relatively close to our area, even if it's maybe Toronto or Mississauga, there has to be some sort of fair or show that happens, like, March or even February where it's indoors, but there's gonna be lots of vendors in there that we could just walk around and say, hey. Like, are you looking? Because vendors like that love cheap opportunities of where to go, and ours cost $250 for a booth. We can definitely find vendors. Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** know what we can also do is I'm gonna just research because I'm just looking, but there's, like, fairs or some kind of shows that what we if it's, relatively close to our area, even if it's maybe Toronto or Mississauga, there has to be some sort of fair or show that happens, like, March or even February where it's indoors, but there's gonna be lots of vendors in there that we could just walk around and say, hey. Like, are you looking? Because vendors like that love cheap opportunities of where to go, and ours cost $250 for a booth. We can definitely find vendors. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** If if we will need to, yes, by all means. But, I'm I'm pretty sure by posting two, three groups, we're gonna have enough. Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Perfect. Can you close the restaurant? That's right. Yeah. You can. No. Not yet. I I think that's what you know, I was even, walking and talking with the guy from the UPS store. Yeah. So we'll have to just come, basically get some posters Yeah. Put in the windows. Which UPS But we also keep in mind too that, Dzara and the local restaurant, they all do you know in person? They can move down. K. And Cox has one that periodically shows up there too that they come down. And and the guy that runs the restaurant what's the big restaurant there in the in the The Burp? Yeah. They're buying banks. There's a No. I know. Boat house. Oh, the boat house? Yeah. Like, I would approach him first because he may say, you know what? Let me do the food.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Perfect. Can you close the restaurant? That's right. Yeah. You can. No. Not yet. I I think that's what you know, I was even, walking and talking with the guy from the UPS store. Yeah. So we'll have to just come, basically get some posters Yeah. Put in the windows. Which UPS But we also keep in mind too that, Dzara and the local restaurant, they all do you know in person?

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Oh,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Oh,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** okay. You know, he might charge you $2 ahead or $5 ahead or whatever. It's a different guy who owns it. The guy who owns it. Is that the, the same as the 5 Yeah. I mean, I've approached this guy one time for our social, and they were really not eligible. But that's that's good. So if they say no, say, okay. Good. Great. Yeah. Good person say you had your chance, man. Yeah. And the food is not good. No. No. No. Literally, the  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** guy  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** who told me, I know we cannot accommodate you. Those guys are kind of it's they are not business, really, oriented. No. In October, it was October was hot. They closed down everything. Crazy. The patios where you have the booth seating. Right? We want, and they're like, no. You can only like, those are preserved for people. It's here. Plan. I live across Okay. So They sold that. But, like, that's no one's here. It's 08:00, and you close at 08:30. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I know. We'll make an exception this time, like now. And I was like, no. It's we can't put you outside. I was like, I don't not looking for you to move the the the tables. Like, we're scattered around. It's social gathering. It's it's like, no. We can't. Maybe it'll take you inside, but inside, it's very big and we cannot give you this because we cannot accommodate. It's like, are you giving me choices or are you just giving me values? It's such a waste of opportunity. Yes. Like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I know. I know. I know. He's the owner. None of the both house. But here is. One of the the owners is  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** who told me, I know we cannot accommodate you. Those guys are kind of it's they are not business, really, oriented. No. In October, it was October was hot. They closed down everything. Crazy. The patios where you have the booth seating. Right? We want, and they're like, no. You can only like, those are preserved for people. It's here. Plan. I live across Okay. So They sold that. But, like, that's no one's here. It's 08:00, and you close at 08:30. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I know. We'll make an exception this time, like now. And I was like, no. It's we can't put you outside. I was like, I don't not looking for you to move the the the tables. Like, we're scattered around. It's social gathering. It's it's like, no. We can't. Maybe it'll take you inside, but inside, it's very big and we cannot give you this because we cannot accommodate. It's like, are you giving me choices or are you just giving me values? It's such a waste of opportunity. Yes. Like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I know. I know. I know. He's the owner. None of the both house. But here is. One of the the owners is  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Peruvian,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** my brother, my friend. And then there is this other restaurant. I don't remember the name. The Colangian Coffee? No. No. No. I also know them. They they used to be the cove. Yeah. When they changed, I called the new one. The marine the marine tower. Yes. That's right. The owners are Peruvian. She's my friend also. So I can talk with her because you  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** my brother, my friend. And then there is this other restaurant. I don't remember the name. The Colangian Coffee? No. No. No. I also know them. They they used to be the cove. Yeah. When they changed, I called the new one. The marine the marine tower. Yes. That's right. The owners are Peruvian. She's my friend also. So I can talk with her because you  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** know, it's  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** know, it's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** bigger and but I don't know what you mean exactly, but I definitely a lot of business from from just the people in Yeah. Yeah. That we have a lot of time here. It's June. June. So it's just basically, I'm drinking weather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's super approachable. Yeah. Sorry. Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** bigger and but I don't know what you mean exactly, but I definitely a lot of business from from just the people in Yeah. Yeah. That we have a lot of time here. It's June. June. So it's just basically, I'm drinking weather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's super approachable. Yeah. Sorry. Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** So then so then for so you would be approaching them for, let's say, let's say, sponsorship opportunity then, I'm assuming, or vendors? What do you guys think?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We were we were thinking on the vendor side because, like, how do we like, we're trying to solve a food problem. Well, so here here's my view on this. There is the park where you can have food trucks and food banks. Right. That's what it so right there. Plank, the cove, what everybody else is gonna get the food traffic of people coming through with the Yes. I agree. Anything else. Right? The question then the question is then, do you do a do you do a gift certificate? They put a sponsorship in. They get a gift certificate to draw more people to the thing. That, to me, I think, is a better approach to project.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So these  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** type  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** of restaurants are not a park type of restaurants. Like, you would need more, like, I don't know, sandwiches in in in the park, in the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** of restaurants are not a park type of restaurants. Like, you would need more, like, I don't know, sandwiches in in in the park, in the  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** parks.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So so so so the so the Marine Tavern, they do in the summer. They have a barbecue out there. Oh, okay. Okay. And they do they do hamburgers and everything else. They could quite happily do that, but at their restaurant as opposed to Yeah. That's the one. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. We need to we need to if we're bringing them food traffic, they need to give us some money from a sponsorship perspective. So we need to go figure that out. Yeah. Okay.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I think them they yeah. They would be better with sponsorship pressure. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Makes sense too. Yeah. I gotta talk to a local pet store, but they wanna sponsor. They wanna be a part of it. Okay. Cool. Okay. My wife  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Makes sense too. Yeah. I gotta talk to a local pet store, but they wanna sponsor. They wanna be a part of it. Okay. Cool. Okay. My wife  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** always  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** always  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** goes there. And she's and, yeah, I come up with stupid ideas, so I'm gonna throw this out to you. Should anybody or I I can try and approach to see if a high school band would wanna come in at the two kilometer mark or have them in the in the area. You can look at a cheer squad. Like That's actually Or running. Pretty good. Have that part of the course, and then they get to do their, volunteer I actually watched that video with the, with the drums. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's And it's so cool. And, you know, for runners, that's what we need. It's just something that'd be fun to go out to events. So it's not just a five k run. Oh,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We had a, a a band or another way, then we had some cheerleaders another way. Like, I don't even know if those cheerleaders existed. I don't think they're in school. She Oh, we dress a bunch of guys up that are Bronte Runner. Themselves. And wear the Bronte Runners thing, and we do the pop bombs for everybody. Let's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We had a, a a band or another way, then we had some cheerleaders another way. Like, I don't even know if those cheerleaders existed. I don't think they're in school. She Oh, we dress a bunch of guys up that are Bronte Runner. Themselves. And wear the Bronte Runners thing, and we do the pop bombs for everybody. Let's  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** do it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** That's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** That's  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** awesome.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** awesome.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You can get 10 of us to dress up at the thing with wings, and then we'll be the, pop bomb people. Right. Yeah. Just, again, come up with little every kilometer or something that we have a little bit of an event. Would this something that's going on with the tour? From their side? Or Yeah. So it's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You can get 10 of us to dress up at the thing with wings, and then we'll be the, pop bomb people. Right. Yeah. Just, again, come up with little every kilometer or something that we have a little bit of an event. Would this something that's going on with the tour? From their side? Or Yeah. So it's  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** theirs.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** theirs.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Two bands. Right? Yeah. Sorry? Yeah. We don't need a lot. Maybe three if you want one at the turnaround. Yeah. And just again, not not many because it's only five k. You need more if you had a 10 k. They only  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** need  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** to play one song. Yeah. Miles, do you think  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** to play one song. Yeah. Miles, do you think  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** can you take charge of  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** can you take charge of  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** that  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** then? I'm  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** then? I'm  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** gonna  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** gonna  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** put  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** down.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** down.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Pardon me? Can you take charge  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Pardon me? Can you take charge  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** of that? Yeah. I'll I'll I'll  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** try and, hit hit the schools up to see what the story is. I'm scared to ask about Nice. To do that. I'll be calling, calling you to be able to yell.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Miles, do you think that you'd be going though in person, or would you just be, like, calling them?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** No. Just repeat. Just hold on. Sure. It's actually I know if it's a director or, like you know, the Burlington Marsh band? Yeah. Okay. He needs Oh, that'd be great. Alright. Cool. That's yeah. Yeah. That's cool. That's what we we asked a tune to a band to come to our race, and they always do. And we we don't want the whole band. We just want the drum corps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's wicked. It's really loud. It's awesome. Yeah. And then, you know, if the kids are there, they actually let the kids take the sticks and play the drums. Right. So it's a little fun day for me. Sounds like a very Elvin Jones kind of. I'll grab an email. Or grab some. Sure. And maybe we can meet him outside this. Sure. So so just so you know, the sound guy that I use is the head guy or teacher band. Okay. So when I hear his name, like, it's a double line again. Okay. Then if you have someone that he's already That'd be great. Used to this, then I think this goes for a 100%. And then we have the other backup. 100%. Yeah. And just, again, just trying to create more of an event for the for the runners. Right? It becomes more fun. Right? But,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I mean,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** doing  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** that also involves more people. So, like, if you guys can even also hit that school up, it still involves more people who then invite their parents or their parents will come and watch. So I think that even having two sets is awesome because that's just yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** that also involves more people. So, like, if you guys can even also hit that school up, it still involves more people who then invite their parents or their parents will come and watch. So I think that even having two sets is awesome because that's just yeah.

You can send them a flyer to this. Can I do that? Is is it allowed? Because some groups it's I'm part of some other groups that it's forbidden. I cannot as well. To them. As well. It's not part of that. But I yeah. Because I can say, hey. I'm like because they are part of the group, so I would like to message them one day. You can invite people to, certain groups or events. So we have created, an event for Bronte Harbour Classic, which has this it's a separate, Facebook group. So all you do is just go into a diff if you are part of a many groups, you can invite people from those groups to our event. But what I do is say what like, personalizing, like, say, hi. Miles. Yeah.

How risky are you? Volunteer for the race? Do you want to do you and and then basically say, please reply on what how you're going to basically work with us. Because if if it's much harder when we put on Facebook, you get 2% response. Yes. Okay. But if I send you a direct question Yes. What are you doing for the Bronte Runners on Father's Day? Well, what do we need more? We need runners to register or we need people to have I think at that point of time, we need runners to register. To say no. I'm busy or whatever. That's fine. But we're No. I'm busy or whatever. That's fine. But we are asking them a specific question. Are you going to run-in the race? Are you going to volunteer in the race? Okay?

**Greg Kowalczyk:** we need  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** think to yeah. I think we should be, I I think that Greg I know last time we talked was just getting the, the the the plan and the layout. Yeah. I was actually looking at this. And then maybe maybe you and I can just have a look at this. But, you know, like, right right now is, before we before we can submit the traffic plan, because this is the first thing that we can do it with city. And, you know, until I have that, which I talked with Greg the traffic plan. Yeah. Yeah. So once we have the traffic plan, we can submit for approval, and then they can give us the map of the park, and then we can And everything. Right? Yeah. But right now, it's just, you know, at the same time, we'll be doing, you know, inviting vendors. And then I just wanna make like, if we look at the layout, because both the inviting vendors, the gradations, like, we just, like, what size plots are they getting geared? How big No. 10 by 10 by 10. And I can I can, even I can show you on a map, you know, on a Google map, you know, how we're gonna lay it out because we'll have to just I think well, that's all? I just just wanna make sure that we just do that, like, the rudimentary layout piece Yeah. And get that done. And then as the pages come in Yeah. We have to allocate it. We get the proper map and start allocating Even come on Saturday, we we can walk, walk by. Okay. And, you know, I'll I'll show you what's what's, what's there. I wasn't planning to run on Saturday, but now That's correct. I like Sundays. But You were in I both days. Yeah. I at a certain point, I would Yeah. I need to wake up first. Alright. Well, chilly is just around the corner. So But but I did I hit this mental threshold of doing 18 k on a 400 meter track. Oh, really? That was, like,  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** I think  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** in Egypt. Wow. Yes. Not running in winter. Not running just running 45 laps. Oh my god. Yeah. Because otherwise, if I run-in the roadside, I won't come on one piece. No. No. No. No. No. No. We were I couldn't run-in the d I couldn't run-in the d r. No. Well, I did we ran on the beach, but by time Yeah. Yeah. I was very trying to run-in that way before. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Turn back. Sorry. Sorry. Where? Oh, no. Ours our problem was, There's no there's no sidewalk. There's no sidewalk? Yeah. The Egypt is the same. Otherwise, it's for one road there's just one road that feeds everything. Yeah. From the airports all the way down. I don't know. And it's it's two it's it's one way each way. Cars, motorbikes, people, pedestrians, cement trucks. So it's like I said, I wanna stay in one piece. So, yeah, I took the truck. Yeah. Yeah. 18 kilometers. That's that's pretty That's a pretty trying to think that for the furthest I run around the track is probably  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** 10 k.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** 10 k.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Me too. Eighteen, eighteen is But the difference is when I did the 18 k a couple of days later, I start at 20 on the track is okay. Yeah. Yeah. I was mentally unstable doing the Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's me like it's like me like in the pool, though, when I'm when I'm swimming. If I'm on my own swimming pool Yeah. Up and down laps. Like, I did on my own. It's hard to get up for, like, two kilometers because then my brain starts to go Oh, yeah. Okay. So I think we can, yeah, grab Next meeting?

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah. I mean, like, whatever you guys can you come up with yeah. There's it'd be nice to just interject, like, real running stuff.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. The content generation is most of the time is just basically, the most difficult. And  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You know, the, the best one would be shorts, like, short videos.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Videos for sure has to be short videos. And, ideally, it would be posted on somebody else's account and then collaborated with us so that it looks like other people posting as opposed to just, us. So  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We can what we can do, we can, either use the, social monials or No.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** Don't complicate it. That's complicating it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Not when  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Not when

**Greg Kowalczyk:** scheduled.  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** We already have it mapped out in the schedule. It's fine except other people I don't wanna if somebody wants to create content and post it on their on their social, share it, add us as a collaborator so that it shows up on our page. Perfect. That's all that let's not complicate the process.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So so let's maybe do a post in, Bronte Rane's group to ask people to do that as well, to share  
**Patricia Kowalczyk:** that. Yeah. Bronte and I'll post this

**Patricia Kowalczyk:** More options. I know I haven't done it in a while. So, yes, I will add that into the list.
