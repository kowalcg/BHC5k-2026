**Dear CIBC Community Investment Team,**

**RE: Bronte Harbour Classic 5K - Inaugural Community Race Event**

I hope this letter finds you well. I'm reaching out on behalf of our volunteer race committee with an exciting opportunity for CIBC to be part of something special happening right here in our community.

We're launching the very first **Bronte Harbour Classic 5K** on **Father's Day, June 21, 2026**, and we'd love to have CIBC join us as a partner in bringing this community celebration to life.

## What We're Building

This is more than just another race—we're creating a new Father's Day tradition for our community. Picture families gathering in beautiful Bronte Harbour Park, kids running their hearts out in the 1K fun run, and the whole community coming together to celebrate health, wellness, and the place we all call home.

The Town of Oakville has given us the green light, and Halton Regional Police are on board to help us make it happen. Now we're assembling the partners who will help make this vision a reality.

**Event Highlights:**
- **Main Event**: 5K certified race course through scenic Bronte Harbour
- **Kids 1K Fun Run**: Special race for children to encourage active lifestyles
- **Father's Day Festival**: Post-race celebration with local vendors, food trucks, entertainment, and family activities
- **Expected Participants**: 500-1,000 runners and their families
- **Community Impact**: Estimated 2,000-3,000 total attendees throughout the day

## Why We're Doing This

Honestly? We believe Bronte Harbour deserves its own signature event—something that brings neighbors together, gets families active, and creates memories that last. We want kids to grow up remembering their first race, parents to have something to train for together, and our community to have one more reason to be proud of where we live.

We're also committed to giving back, with a portion of proceeds supporting local charities and community initiatives.

## The Difference This Will Make

We're expecting 500-1,000 runners plus their families—that's roughly 2,000-3,000 people celebrating together in Bronte Harbour Park. Local vendors will have a chance to showcase what they do, kids will have a blast, and we'll be putting our beautiful community on the map for runners across the region.

Beyond race day, we're building something that will come back year after year, becoming a tradition that families look forward to and a source of pride for everyone who calls this area home.

## Where CIBC Comes In

Here's the thing—we're a volunteer-run committee doing this because we love our community, but we need partners who share that vision. That's why we're reaching out to CIBC.

Through Judi's connection to your team, we know CIBC is already invested in this community. We're inviting you to support this inaugural event in whatever way makes sense for CIBC.

### How You Can Help

We're currently finalizing our formal sponsorship packages (which will include options at various levels with specific benefits), but we didn't want to wait to reach out. We know timing matters for corporate giving decisions.

**Here's what we're thinking:**

A contribution of **$5,000** would position CIBC as a significant sponsor of this inaugural event, with recognition including:
- Logo placement on race materials and promotional collateral
- Social media recognition throughout our marketing campaign
- Event signage visibility
- Recognition as a founding supporter of this new community tradition

We're flexible and happy to work with whatever level of support makes sense for CIBC—whether that's a formal sponsorship once our packages are finalized, or a community contribution to help get this inaugural event off the ground.

The important thing is that we'd love to have CIBC be part of creating this new Bronte tradition from the very beginning.

## Why This Makes Sense for CIBC

Look, we get it—you probably receive sponsorship requests all the time. Here's why this one is different:

- **You're already here**: Through your Oakville branches and team members like Judi's husband, you're part of this community
- **It's authentic**: A Father's Day race that brings families together aligns naturally with what CIBC stands for
- **It's the beginning**: Being a founding partner of something new means more than just sponsoring year 15 of an established event
- **It matters**: This isn't just logos and visibility—it's about genuinely supporting community health and connection
- **It's lasting**: This will become an annual tradition, and CIBC will be remembered as one of the partners who made it happen

## Let's Talk

I'd love to grab a coffee or hop on a call to chat more about this. I can share our detailed plans, walk through our formal sponsorship packages when they're finalized, answer any questions, and see if this feels like the right fit for CIBC.

No pressure, no hard sell—just a conversation about how we can work together to create something meaningful for the community we both serve.

I'm happy to provide whatever additional information would be helpful:
- Our detailed event plan and timeline
- Expected participant numbers and reach
- Draft sponsorship package options (when finalized)
- How we'll recognize and activate sponsors
- Anything else you'd like to know

Thanks for taking the time to read this. We're reaching out early because we want founding partners who share our vision to be part of this from the ground up. Whether CIBC comes on board now or once our formal packages are ready, we'd love to have you involved.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
