### Pricing Strategy Notes:

**Year 1 (2026) - Inaugural/Founding Rate:**
- Lower pricing creates "ground floor" opportunity
- Emphasize FOUNDING SPONSOR positioning
- Multi-year deals lock in inaugural rates for full term

**Year 2 (2027) - Established Event:**
- 20% increase across major tiers (rounded to nearest $1,000)
- Demonstrates event value and success from Year 1
- Still competitive compared to established races

**Year 3-4 (2028-2029) - Market Rate:**
- Match Moon In June pricing on comparable categories
- By Year 3, event has proven track record
- Full market value positioning

**Multi-Year Lock-In Strategy:**
- Sponsors who commit to 2-3 years in 2026 lock in inaugural rates for full term
- Example: 3-year Title Sponsor pays $30,000 total (2026-2028), saving $15,000+ vs. year-by-year pricing
- Creates strong incentive for long-term commitments in Year 1

### Revenue Impact Example:

**If sold at Year 1 rates:**
- Title Sponsor (3-year): $30,000
- 2× Presenting (3-year): $30,000
- Total: $60,000

**If sold year-by-year at increasing rates:**
- Title: $8,000 + $10,000 + $15,000 = $33,000
- Presenting (×2): ($5,000 + $6,000 + $10,000) × 2 = $42,000
- Total: $75,000

**Difference:** Founding sponsors save $15,000 by committing long-term, but you secure guaranteed revenue and partnership stability.

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

**The Bronte Harbour Classic sponsorship package is HIGHLY COMPETITIVE and well-structured.** It successfully balances being accessible for an inaugural event while offering comprehensive benefits that rival the 37-year-established Moon In June.

**Key Recommendation:** Keep current pricing but enhance the positioning with "Founding Sponsor" language and add the minor benefits/clarifications outlined above. This creates urgency and exclusivity while maintaining competitive pricing that makes sense for a first-year event.

**The package is READY for the Toronto Marathon Expo** with minor tweaks. BHC is positioned to successfully attract high-quality sponsors who want to be part of creating a new Oakville tradition.
