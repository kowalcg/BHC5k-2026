## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

1. **JavaScript-Rendered Directories**: Burlington Chamber and some BIA directories use JavaScript widgets that require browser rendering
2. **Rate Limiting**: Firecrawl rate limits prevented complete crawling of all directories
3. **Dynamic Content**: Some directories load content dynamically, requiring specialized extraction

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Complete Data Extraction:

1. **Manual Review Required**: 
   - Burlington Chamber directory (JavaScript-based)
   - Oakville Chamber directory
   - Kerr Village BIA directory

2. **Alternative Methods**:
   - Use browser automation (Puppeteer/Playwright) for JavaScript-rendered directories
   - Direct API access if available
   - Manual data entry for critical directories

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Continue crawling remaining directories after rate limit reset
   - Extract individual business pages from Oakville Downtown BIA category pages
   - Scrape Downtown Milton individual business listings
   - Map Kerr Village and Oakville Chamber directories

---
