## 📊 METRICS TO ADD

**Dashboard Should Track**:
- [ ] **Registration Velocity** (registrations per week/day)
- [ ] **Budget vs. Actual** (real-time financial tracking)
- [ ] **Volunteer Count** (current vs. needed)
- [ ] **Task Completion Rate** (tasks completed per week)
- [ ] **Critical Path Status** (are critical items on track?)
- [ ] **Risk Status** (number of open high-risk items)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: OVERALL PROGRESS CALCULATION

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: The Overall Progress must ALWAYS be recalculated whenever ANY committee progress percentage is updated.

**Calculation Method**:
- Overall Progress = Average of all 6 committee progress percentages
- Committees: Route + Promotion + Start/Finish + Registration + Post-Race + Financial
- Formula: Sum of all 6 percentages ÷ 6

**Current Values (as of review)**:
- Route: 10%
- Promotion: 8%
- Start/Finish: 5%
- Registration: 40%
- Post-Race: 10%
- Financial: 25%
- **Average/Overall: 16%**

**Action Required**: 
- ✅ **ALWAYS** update Overall Progress when updating any committee progress
- ✅ Update BOTH locations: stat card at top AND progress bar in overview section
- ✅ Recalculate: Add all 6 committee percentages, divide by 6, round to nearest whole number

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDED NEW SECTIONS

### Option 1: Add New Tab
**"🚨 Risk & Operations"** tab covering:
- Risk Management
- Emergency Protocols
- Race Day Operations Manual
- Post-Race Evaluation

### Option 2: Expand Project Oversight
Add comprehensive subsections to existing Project Oversight tab

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate**: Add Risk Management section (critical for insurance and safety)
2. **Short-term**: Create Race Day Operations Manual (essential for execution)
3. **Medium-term**: Complete all missing planning details identified above
4. **Ongoing**: Regular dashboard reviews and updates

**The dashboard is a strong foundation, but these additions will ensure comprehensive race management and successful execution.**
