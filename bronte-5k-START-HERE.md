## After Analysis Completes

- ✅ Verify timeline is achievable (8 months is tight but doable)
- ✅ Ensure volunteer roles are clear
- ✅ Confirm marketing plan aligns with Toronto Marathon Expo timing

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

If anything is unclear:
```
Cursor, explain more about [specific item] - give me step-by-step details.
```

If you want deeper analysis:
```
Cursor, create a detailed budget spreadsheet with formulas and monthly cash flow tracking.
```

If you need specific documents:
```
Cursor, create the sponsorship package document ready to send to potential sponsors.
```

---

## Monthly Management (Going Forward)

### First Monday of Each Month, Ask Cursor:

```
Cursor, provide Bronte Harbour Classic 5K monthly status report:
- Days until race: [auto-calculate]
- Budget status: revenue projection vs. actuals
- Timeline: what's on track, what's delayed
- Critical blockers: what needs immediate attention
- Next 30 days: top 5 priorities
- Risk updates: any new concerns

Format as executive summary I can share with race committee.
```

### When You Need Quick Decisions:

```
Cursor, I need to decide: [describe situation]

Give me:
1. Pros and cons of each option
2. What would Moon in June do? (Greg Pace's approach)
3. Your recommendation with rationale
4. Budget impact if applicable
```

### When Things Get Stressful:

```
Cursor, I'm feeling overwhelmed with race planning on top of running TapeGeeks and GearTOP.

What are the ONLY 3 things I MUST focus on this week for the race? Everything else can wait.
```

## Key Reminders

### You're Not Alone
- **Greg Pace**: 37 years organizing Moon in June - lean on him
- **Bronte Runners**: Existing volunteer base - use them!
- **Cursor AI**: Your 24/7 race director assistant - ask anything

### Realistic Expectations for Year 1
- Target: 300-500 participants (not 2,000)
- Goal: Break even or small surplus
- Focus: Quality execution > big scale
- Success: Happy participants who return next year

### Timeline Reality Check
You have 8 months:
- **Oct-Nov 2025**: Planning, permit approval, committee formation
- **Dec 2025**: Marketing launch, early bird registration
- **Jan-Mar 2026**: Sponsor acquisition, volunteer recruitment
- **Apr-May 2026**: Logistics finalization, final push
- **June 2026**: Race week and RACE DAY (June 21)

### Critical Path Items
Must have these or race can't happen:
1. ✅ Town of Oakville permit (expect approval soon)
2. ✅ Event insurance
3. ✅ Timing system booked
4. ✅ Course finalized
5. ✅ Core volunteers committed

## Integration with Your Other Projects

- **Email list building** for future marketing

- **TapeGeeks sponsorship** = marketing investment, not just expense

### Time Management
You can't do everything yourself:
- **Race committee**: Delegate operations to Bronte Runners

- **Greg Pace advisor**: Use his experience to avoid mistakes
- **Cursor AI**: Your planning and tracking assistant
- **Your role**: Strategy, sponsor relationships, race day MC/leadership

## Questions? Problems?

### If Cursor Doesn't Work:
- Make sure project folders are in the workspace
- Use @ symbol to reference specific files
- Try shorter, simpler commands first

### If Analysis is Too Generic:
Ask: "Cursor, be more specific about [X] - give me detailed steps and examples."

### If You Disagree with Recommendations:
Say: "Cursor, I don't think [X] will work because [reason]. What's an alternative approach?"

### If Timeline Seems Unrealistic:
Ask: "Cursor, this timeline feels tight. What can we cut or defer to year 2 without hurting race quality?"
