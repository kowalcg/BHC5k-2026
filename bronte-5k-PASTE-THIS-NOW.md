## What Cursor Will Do

### It Will Analyze:
- Moon in June reference materials (Greg Pace's 37-year proven model)
- Your preliminary budget
- All race planning documents
- Town correspondence
- Expo booth planning

### It Will Recommend:
- **Co-Director Role Split**: Strategic focus for Greg K. and Charles
  - Example: Greg = Business/Sponsorship/Marketing/Budget strategy
  - Example: Charles = Operations strategy/Volunteer leadership/Community relations
  
- **Staff Roles**: Clear operational responsibilities
  - Yasimin = Day-to-day execution, vendor coordination, logistics, race day operations
  - Judi = Timeline management, accountability tracking, status reporting, risk escalation

- **How They Work Together**: Decision flow and communication structure
  
- **Greg Pace Advisor Usage**: When and how to consult him (monthly check-ins? specific decisions?)

- **Future Committee**: How to organize Bronte Runners volunteers into sub-committees (who reports to whom)

---

## Why This Matters

Having a complete leadership team is essential for a first-year community race:

**Co-Directors** (Greg K. & Charles):
- ✅ Strategic decisions and big-picture direction
- ✅ Shared leadership and community representation
- ✅ Different skill sets complement each other
- ✅ Not buried in day-to-day details

**Professional Staff** (Yasimin & Judi):
- ✅ Actually EXECUTES the race operations
- ✅ Greg can run TapeGeeks/GearTOP while race moves forward
- ✅ Someone owns the timeline (Judi) so nothing slips
- ✅ Someone coordinates daily activities (Yasimin)
- ✅ Professional execution, not just volunteers

**Advisor** (Greg Pace):
- ✅ 37 years of wisdom without operational burden
- ✅ Available for guidance when needed
- ✅ Adds credibility to your first-year race
- ✅ He can enjoy advising without the stress of running it

This structure lets you focus on STRATEGY (sponsorships, budget, big decisions) while Yasimin and Judi handle EXECUTION (operations, timeline, coordination).

## After Cursor Responds

### Review the Role Division Recommendation
Cursor will suggest something like:

- **Charles**: Operations, logistics, volunteers, race day execution

### Discuss with Charles
- Do the recommended roles match your strengths and interests?
- Do you have the time for your assigned areas?
- Any adjustments needed?

### Consult Greg Pace
- Show him the proposed structure
- Ask: "Does this match how Moon in June is organized?"
- Get his input on the role split

### Finalize and Document
- Lock in who does what
- Share with Bronte Runners
- Use this as your operating model
