### Operations Team (Professional Staff)
⚙️ **Focus**: Day-to-day execution, coordination, timeline management

**Yasimin Bleik** - Race Coordinator
- **What she does**: 
  - Executes all the operational details
  - Coordinates vendors, sponsors, volunteers
  - Manages race logistics (registration, course, supplies)
  - Solves day-to-day problems
  - Runs race day operations
  - Liaison between co-directors and everyone else

- **Why critical**: Frees co-directors from daily details, ensures things actually get done

**Judi Meston** - Project Manager
- **What she does**:
  - Owns the master timeline (October 2025 → June 21, 2026)
  - Tracks all milestones and deliverables
  - Holds people accountable for their tasks
  - Identifies risks and bottlenecks
  - Reports status to co-directors
  - Ensures nothing falls through cracks
  
- **Why critical**: Someone must watch the calendar or tasks slip. She's the accountability person.

**Together**: Execute the race, manage operations, keep everything on track

### Advisory (Wisdom & Experience)
💡 **Focus**: Guidance based on 37 years of proven success

**Greg Pace** - Race Advisor
- **What he does**:
  - Shares Moon in June best practices
  - Reviews plans and offers recommendations
  - Available for consultations on specific issues
  - Provides wisdom when asked
  
- **What he doesn't do**:
  - Day-to-day operations
  - Attend every meeting
  - Make decisions (that's co-directors' job)
  - Execute tasks

- **Why this works**: He has invaluable experience but doesn't need the operational burden. Use his wisdom strategically.
