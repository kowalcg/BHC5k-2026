- **Parent captions:** Warm, family-focused, kids emphasis
- **Corporate captions:** Professional, ROI-driven, no slang
- **Competitive captions:** Technical, performance-focused
- **First-timer captions:** Encouraging, supportive
- **Local captions:** Community-proud, Bronte-focused

**Timeline:** This week (3-4 hours of focused development)
