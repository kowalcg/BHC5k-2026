### Tip 2: Batch Create Content
Spend 30 minutes on Sunday:
- Generate 5 different content types
- Pick best captions
- Export all
- Schedule for the week

### Tip 3: Regenerate Multiple Times
First generation = good. Regenerate 3x = 30 captions to choose from = best caption guaranteed!

### Tip 4: Use AI Platform Variations
Generate image 3-5 times in Gemini/ChatGPT, pick best result. Each generation is slightly different.

### Tip 5: A/B Test Everything
Generate same category with:
- Different audiences (First-Timers vs Experienced)
- Different tones (Casual vs Formal)
- Different platforms (Instagram vs Facebook)

Compare performance. Double down on what works.
