### Issue: Hashtags Look Similar Across Captions

**This is CORRECT!** Each caption has:
- Same core brand tags: #BronteHarbourClassic #BronteHarbour5K (always included)
- Different rotating location/race/motivation tags (unique per caption)
- Caption #1 will have #OakvilleON #BronteHarbour
- Caption #2 will have #HaltonRegion #GTA
- Caption #3 will have #BurlingtonON #LakeOntario

This is INTENTIONAL for brand consistency while reaching different micro-communities!
