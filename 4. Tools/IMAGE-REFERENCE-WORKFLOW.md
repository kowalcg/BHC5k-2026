## 🎯 PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

### Tip 1: Build a Reference Library EARLY
- **When:** December 2025 (before content ramp-up)
- **Why:** One-time effort, use all season
- **How:** Spend 1-2 hours taking/gathering photos
- **Result:** Consistent, authentic content for 6 months

### Tip 2: Update References Seasonally
- **Winter:** Snow-covered Bronte (if applicable)
- **Spring:** Trees budding, fresh green
- **Summer:** Full foliage, beach activity (race day look)
- **Why:** Match current season in your posts

### Tip 3: Get Professional Photos (If Budget Allows)
- **Hire local photographer:** 2-hour shoot at Bronte ($200-500)
- **Deliverables:** 20-30 high-quality reference photos
- **ROI:** Use all season, professional quality
- **Alternative:** Oakville Tourism may have free media library

### Tip 4: User-Generated Content (UGC)
- **Ask past participants:** Share Bronte photos (with rights)
- **Instagram search:** #BronteHarbour #BronteOakville
- **Community groups:** Oakville Facebook groups
- **Always:** Credit photographer, ask permission

### Tip 5: Combine Multiple References
For complex posts, use 2-3 references:

**Example: Father's Day Registration Post**
- Reference 1: Bronte lighthouse (location)
- Reference 2: Dad + kids running (father's day vibe)
- Reference 3: Finish line celebration (race energy)

**Prompt:** "Combine these 3 elements into one cohesive image..."

**Result:** Highly specific, emotionally resonant, perfectly on-brand
