### **4. REGENERATE BUTTON FIXED** 🔄 CRITICAL FIX!

**Problem in V1.0:**
```javascript
function regenerateContent() {
    // Used cached old settings!
    const imagePrompt = buildImagePrompt(lastGeneratedOptions);
    const socialPosts = buildSocialMediaCopy(lastGeneratedOptions, true);
}
```
❌ **Audience change NOT reflected in regenerated content!**

**FIXED in V1.1:**
```javascript
function regenerateContent() {
    // Uses CURRENT form state!
    const currentOptions = getOptions();
    
    if (!currentOptions.category) {
        alert('Please select a content category');
        return;
    }
    
    // Generates with CURRENT settings
    const imagePrompt = buildImagePrompt(currentOptions);
    const socialPosts = buildSocialMediaCopy(currentOptions, true);
    
    displayContent(imagePrompt, socialPosts, currentOptions);
    
    // Updates cache AFTER using new settings
    lastGeneratedOptions = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(currentOptions));
}
```
✅ **Audience change IMMEDIATELY reflected!**

**Testing Workflow:**
1. Generate content with "Millennials" → Casual, energetic captions
2. Change audience to "Parents" → (don't generate yet)
