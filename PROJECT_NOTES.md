## 💡 TIPS FOR AI ASSISTANT

When working with this project:
1. Always use "Greg K" and "Greg P" to distinguish the two Gregs
2. Verify race details (2026, not 2025; 8:00 AM for all races)
3. Keep sponsorship pricing confidential
4. Support teams are "To be formed" unless specifically named
5. Oakville Dads and Kerr Mission are the charity partners (NOT CAFH)
6. Vendor booth pricing ($250) is PUBLIC, sponsorship tiers are NOT
7. Meeting minutes are the authoritative source for decisions
